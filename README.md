Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is the most severe form of male infertility. Currently known causative factors, including congenital and several acquired causes can only account for approximately 30% of NOA cases. Causes for most patients with NOA remains unclear, which were known as idiopathic NOA (iNOA). However, whether iNOA is congenital defects or acquired abnormalities is a confusing problem due to the delayed diagnosis of this frustrating situation until childbearing age.

This project attempt to find different expressed genes and related functions of iNOA patients. In this study, several patients who were diagnosed as iNOA at this stage, but with a history of natural conceptions with female before were enrolled and defined as “secondary idiopathic NOA”. As little was known about these cases, we performed the mRNA expression profiling by Next-generation sequencing (NGS) in this three patients and other three patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA) as controls.

The code case_control_compare_deseq2.r was used to calculated different expressed genes between NOA cases and unaffected controls. The clusterProfiler_enrich.R was used to perform gene ontology and KEGG enrichment, and plot related figures in the manuscript(>Altered mRNA profile in testis of patients with secondary idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia).
